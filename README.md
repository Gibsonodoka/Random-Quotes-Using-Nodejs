# Random-Quotes-Using-Nodejs
a simple HTTP server using the Node.js http module that listens on the localhost IP address (127.0.0.1) and port 3000. When a request is made to this server (by visiting http://localhost:3000 in a web browser), the server responds with a random quote obtained from the Quotable API (https://api.quotable.io/).
